"""Generate a TASK-granular historical corpus and (optionally) ingest it (S09).

The Session 8 corpus (``data/budgets_sample.json``) is coarse — one chunk per
budget *component*. The Session 9 estimate is a module → task breakdown, so to
ground fine-grained tasks we need historical evidence at the same granularity.

This script synthesises realistic historical projects, each decomposed into
functional MODULES and, within each module, concrete TASKS with hours. Every
task becomes a :class:`BudgetComponent` tagged with its ``module``, so the
existing structural chunker emits one chunk per task. Generation is fully
offline and DETERMINISTIC (seeded), so re-running yields the same corpus and the
idempotent ingest never duplicates.

Usage::

    # generate data/task_corpus.json only (review before ingesting)
    docker compose run --rm estimator python scripts/build_task_corpus.py --generate-only

    # generate + ingest into pgvector (needs OPENAI_API_KEY for embeddings)
    docker compose run --rm estimator python scripts/build_task_corpus.py --ingest

    # from the host with the API on localhost:8000
    uv run python scripts/build_task_corpus.py --ingest

Wipe the corpus anytime (it is opt-in, tagged by document_type)::

    DELETE FROM documents WHERE document_type = 'historical_task_breakdown';
