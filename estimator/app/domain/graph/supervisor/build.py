"""Wire and compile the supervisor graph (Session 14).

The topology is a STAR, which is what a supervisor system should look like when you
draw it — not a line with more boxes::

            START
              │
              ▼
       ┌─▶ supervisor ──Command(goto)──┬──▶ requirements_extractor ──┐
       │                               ├──▶ budget_searcher ─────────┤
       │                               ├──▶ estimate_generator ──────┤
       └──────── static return ────────┼──▶ coherence_validator ─────┘
         edges                         │
                                       └──▶ human_review_gate ──▶ END

* **Dynamic edges** — the five ``supervisor → {4 agents, gate}`` hand-overs. These do
  not exist in the graph definition at all: ``Command(goto=...)`` draws them at
  runtime. That is the point of the session.
* **Static edges** — ``START → supervisor``, the four ``agent → supervisor`` return
  edges, and ``human_review_gate → END``. Six in total.

``END`` is reached through exactly one edge, whether the gate paused for a human or
fell straight through. One exit is much easier to reason about than two.

Note the gate returns a plain dict rather than a ``Command``. Mixing ``interrupt()``
with a ``Command`` return in one node is legal, but the resume path re-executes and
would have to reconstruct the same ``Command`` — one more thing to get wrong, for no
benefit when there is only one destination.
