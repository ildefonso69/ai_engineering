"""Human-in-the-loop: pause when the estimate is not trustworthy enough to ship.

Session 13's gates pause UNCONDITIONALLY at fixed points in the flow. This one pauses
on a SIGNAL: the graph runs unattended when the numbers are well grounded, and stops
for a person exactly when they are not. That difference is the whole point — a human
gate that always fires is a form, not a control.

The three trigger conditions are the ones the exercise names:

1. confidence below the configured threshold,
2. the estimate falls outside the range its historical references imply,
3. the transcript has essentially no precedent in the budget corpus.

The split of responsibility matters and is deliberate: ``coherence_validator`` writes
FACTS (``confidence``, ``out_of_range``, ``grounded_components``); this module owns the
VERDICT. That is what lets the threshold move via configuration — or a second trigger
be added — without touching the validator.
