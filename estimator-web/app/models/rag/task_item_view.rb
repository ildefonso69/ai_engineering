# Mirror of the FastAPI ``TaskItem`` plus the Session 10 per-task hours fields.
# Once estimated, a task carries the hours derived by vector search
# (``estimated_hours`` + ``hours_reliability`` + ``has_match``) and the human-set
# ``rate_eur_per_hour``. ``engineer_days`` stays for the legacy Session 9
# single-shot path (it is nil in the structure-only flow). Per-task citations
# (``sources``) were dropped: the structure is a free decomposition with no
# retrieval, so those ids were always empty and never fed the hours computation.
